            <p>The Philippines is a country located in the Southeast Asia. It's an archipelago composed of 7641 islands. Being an archipelago makes the country's different aspect of cultures very diverse and packed! The country's history was also full of colonialism from Spain, America, and Japan, and other countries, these contributing to the country's unique identity. It's really as we say, "it's more fun in the Philippines!"</p>
