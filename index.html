                <p>Hello! My name is Charles Nephi Salva and I am from the Philippines. I am currently 21 years old. My hobbies are singing and I enjoy gaming! I am the second eldest of five siblings. My family are all members of the Church. I served my mission in the Philippines Angeles Mission for two years. That was in August 2021 - August 2023. I learned a lot in my mission by serving in various assignments. Now that I'm home I'm pursuing marriage and education and this course is part of that. I will be married to Czar Jamie Comploma in July 27, 2024. We also plan to pursue our education further in BYU-Hawaii and live there together. We are applying for the Winter 2025 semester. I want to grow a career in computer science as well as in English fields.</p>

                <p>The Philippines is a country located in the Southeast Asia. It's an archipelago composed of 7641 islands. Being an archipelago makes the country's different aspect of cultures very diverse and packed! The country's history was also full of colonialism from Spain, America, and Japan, and other countries, these contributing to the country's unique identity. It's really as we say, "it's more fun in the Philippines!"</p>
